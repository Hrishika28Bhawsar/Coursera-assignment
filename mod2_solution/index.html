			<h3>Guitar</h3>
			<p>The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. Their strings are made of steel or nylon.The guitar strings are plucked with the fingers and fingernails of the right hand (or left hand, for left), or a small pick made of thin plastic. This type of pick is called a "plectrum" or guitar pick. The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers pluck the strings.

			<h3>Piano</h3>
			<p>The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers)that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike strigs.

			<h3>Flute</h3>
			<p>The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist, fluter or flutenist.Flutes are the earliest extant musical instruments</p>
